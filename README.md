# Road to 1000 Contributions

A repository intended to help KygekDev achieve 1000 contributions in first year using GitHub.

## History

KygekDev joined GitHub on July 16th, 2020, marking his first contribution on GitHub. He made 700+ contributions for the next 6 months on GitHub. Unfortunately, starting on January 2021, he wasn't active on GitHub for next 5 months. After 11 months since he joined GitHub, he started making contributions again. Unfortunately, there is too litte time to achieve 1000 contributions in less than 1 month since he started making contributions again. Because of that, he made this repository to help him actieve 1000 contributions before 1 year has passed since he joined GitHub.

## How this repository works

KygekDev will occasionally make commits in the [`contributions.txt`](/contributions.txt) file to add a contribution mark on his GitHub profile. Each commit will be represented with the following format:

- Commit content: `Contribution No. (VISIBLE_CONTRIBURIONS + 1) - DD-MM-YYYY HH:ii (GMT +8)`
- Commit name: `Contribution No. (VISIBLE_CONTRIBURIONS + 1)`

### Example

COMMIT `8c17d71a1bf55c419ddcd45d57b133c44790bcd6`: Contribution No. 632

`contributions.txt`:
```
+ Contribution No. 632 - 01-01-2021 00:00 (GMT +8)
```
